Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your body forming a straight line from head to heels.\n2. Lower your body by bending your elbows and keeping your back straight. Lower until your chest touches the ground.\n3. Push back up to the starting position by straightening your arms. Make sure to engage your core and keep your body in a straight line throughout the movement.\n4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\n\nPush-ups are a great bodyweight exercise that target the chest, shoulders, and triceps. If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!"

Consistent practice and progression will help you improve your strength over time. Remember to focus on proper form and gradually increase the difficulty as you get stronger.

            "ai_message": "If you have physical limitations that prevent you from performing traditional push-ups, there are still exercises you can do to strengthen your upper body without putting pressure on your bones. Here are some alternative exercises that you can try:\n\n1. **Seated Chest Press**:\n   - Sit on a chair or bench with your back straight and feet flat on the ground.\n   - Hold a pair of dumbbells or resistance bands at chest level.\n   - Push the weights forward until your arms are fully extended and then return to the starting position.\n\n2. **Standing Shoulder Press**:\n   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a pair of dumbbells at shoulder height.\n   - Press the weights overhead until your arms are fully extended and then lower them back down.\n\n3. **Dumbbell Flyes**:\n   - Lie on your back on a bench or the floor with a dumbbell in each hand.\n   - Extend your arms out to the sides with a slight bend in your elbows.\n   - Bring the weights together in front of your chest, squeezing your chest muscles, and then return to the starting position.\n\n4. **Resistance Band Pull-Aparts**:\n   - Hold a resistance band in front of you with your arms extended.\n   - Pull the band apart by bringing your hands to your sides while squeezing your shoulder blades together.\n   - Return to the starting position and repeat.\n\nThese exercises focus on strengthening the chest, shoulders, and arms without putting pressure on your bones. It's important to choose exercises that are safe and comfortable for your unique circumstances. If you have specific limitations or need further guidance, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or a fitness trainer who can provide personalized advice.
